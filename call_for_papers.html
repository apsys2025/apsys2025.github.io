<!--<h1 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h1>-->

<!--
<p>Submissions should be six or fewer pages in length excluding references, formatted in standard 
ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font size. Reviewing will be double-blind : no author or affiliation information should appear in the submission. The authors should additionally follow the best practice in order not to disclose their identities implicitly. A submission may present preliminary results, propose a new research direction, provide insightful retrospective, or offer a provocative viewpoint on an important systems topic. Papers will be selected based on their likelihood of generating insightful technical discussions at the workshop and influencing future systems research. Relevant attributes include originality, technical merit, clarity, and technical relevance. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Consistent with standard scholarly practice, the authors should not have substantially similar work in review anywhere else.</p>

<p>
By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
</p> 



<h1 id="camera_ready">Camera-ready Instructions</h1>
<p> Below are the general formatting rules for the final papers of APSys 2023: 

<ul>
	<li> The final paper, including all text, figures, tables, and any appendices, must fit within the  SIX-page limit. References have no page limit. </li>
	<li> ACM is the publisher for APSys 2023. Please format your final version in standard ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font size. </li>
	<li> Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page. </li>
	<li> Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification. </li>
	<li> Since ACM cannot substitute font types, the fonts of the final papers must be scalable Type 1 fonts, not bit-mapped Type 3. Otherwise, the formatting paper may be rejected during the ACM production procedure. </li>
	<li> All fonts must be embedded. To help you through this process, you can refer to the <a href=https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word-to-pdf-instructions-.txt> embedded font checking guidelines </a> from ACM. </li>
</ul>

<p> To help you with formatting your final papers, we recommend using the <a href=https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip> latex template </a> of <a href=https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template> ACM Proceedings Template. </a>

<ul>
	<li> Please use the standard 'sigconf' proceedings option in '\documentclass'. </li>
	<li> Authors should apply ACM Computing Classification categories and terms. </li>
	<li> ACM has deprecated all older style files and released a new template that supersedes prior templates. Authors should not use the older deprecated versions. </li>
	<li> Authors will receive an email to submit a copyright form formally to ACM. Once ACM approves the submitted form, authors will receive a response that will have the DOI number, ISBN number, and additional information regarding the paper. Authors need to use this information to update the corresponding fields in the latex template, which will be visible at the left bottom of the first page. As rights management emails from <a href=mailto:rightsreview@acm.org> rightsreview@acm.org </a> are sent by an automated system, please check your SPAM folders if they do not appear in your inbox. </li>
</ul>

Please note that the camera-ready paper must be submitted to the <a href=http://apsys2023.hotcrp.com/> submission website </a> by <b> July 21, 2023. </b> For any additional questions, please send an email to the APSys 2023 publication chair: Sungjin Lee <a href=mailto:sungjin.lee@dgist.ac.kr> (sungjin.lee@dgist.ac.kr). </a>
