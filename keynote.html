<h3 id="keynote1">Keynote Talk 1 (Thursday, August 24th)</h3>
<center><h2><b> Experiences with Learned Systems: The good, The Bad and The Ugly </b></h2></center>
<h2>Speaker: Haibo Chen </h2>
<h3>Distinguished Professor, Shanghai Jaio Tong University </h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Talk abstract</h3>
<p>
Many problems in systems software can be transformed into those using machine learning. In this talk, I will share our past experiences of defining and optimizing optimization problems in systems software using machine learning, resulting in a set of learned systems ranging from indexes, concurrency control, and distributed key/value stores. Based on these, I will further describe the learned lessons in applying machine learnings for systems, and discuss possible challenges and opportunities in fostering better synergy between systems and machine learning.

<h3>Keynote Talk 2 (Friday, August 25th)</h3>
<center><h2><b> Behind the scenes of SmartThings  </b></h2></center>
<h2>Speaker: Jaeyeon Jung</h2>
<h3>Executive Vice President and Head of SmartThings, Samsung Electronics </h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Talk abstract</h3>
<p>
To process over 150K events per second to support 120M+ connected devices to the SmartThings platform from 280M+ registered users globally, my team has built and been operating a cloud-based system composed of 200+ microservices deployed across 4 regions. We also support various connectivity protocols like Zigbee, ZWave, Thread, and Wi-Fi through SmartThings Hub to integrate many such partner devices as doorlocks, light bulbs, motion sensors, smart plugs, and etc. In this talk, I’ll share several insights that I learned by working with many talented engineers in my team while building a scalable, secure, performant, and extensible smart home platform.
